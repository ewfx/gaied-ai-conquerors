*Closure of Your Loan Account No. 125734619*
Dear *Customer*,

We are so happy to have had the opportunity of helping you with your loan.
Thank-you for trusting us and we hope that this experience was everything
what it should be!

Your *loan* has been closed as of *27-Feb-25*.

However, there may still be some necessary action which needs your
attention:

*Uncashed Post Dated/ Security Cheques*

   1. We will keep your post-dated/security cheques, marked as "cancelled",
   at our office. We will destroy them after 45 days from the date of the l=
oan
   account's closure. If you want us to send them back to you, please conta=
ct
   us through Phone Banking or visit
   <https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/need-help/contact-us> and make a
   request.

   You can also visit any of our Retail Loan Service Centers (refer to
   www.hdfcbank.com >> Find your nearest >> Retail Loan Service Center for
   addresses/ contact details) and make a request for the return of cancell=
ed
   cheques there. We will not be able to process any requests for unbanked
   cheques after 45 days from the date of closure. The list of Post Dated/
   Security Cheques that remained uncashed as of the date of closure is
   enclosed herewith for your reference.
   2. If your loan has been closed through the pre-payment process, the
   next payment will likely happen on the original date. If the payment
   happens when it is presented, you will get the money back in 10 working
   days. The money will be sent back to you either through a direct credit =
to
   your bank account or through a Pay-Order sent to your mailing address. W=
e
   have already told you this in our offer for foreclosure. Please mark a
   "Stop Payment."
   3. If you have post-dated/security cheques for multiple EMIs, they will
   be presented until the repayment instructions are changed to reflect you=
r
   live account information. If you need assistance, please visit one of ou=
r
   Retail Loans Service Centers. If you need any help with your loan, pleas=
e
   write to loansupport@hdfcbank.com

We will be happy to help you get a different loan or answer any questions
you have.

You can also call our Phone Banking Helpline or go to our website
<https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/need-help/contact-us> and request more
information from one of our authorised representatives.

Warm Regards,
*HDFC Bank Ltd.*
